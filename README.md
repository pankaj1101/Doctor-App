# Doctor App Using Flutter

Myself Pankaj Ram

## Getting Started

This project is created in Flutter using Dart.

I have designed and developed a doctor appointment app using #Flutter, a cross-platform framework. The app allows users to easily find nearby doctors and book #appointments for convenient healthcare access. With a user-friendly interface and advanced search filters, users can quickly discover doctors based on their specialty, location, and availability. The app also incorporates patient reviews and ratings to help users make informed decisions. It provides features such as appointment scheduling, reminders, and secure payment options for a seamless user experience. By leveraging technology, this app aims to improve healthcare accessibility and enhance the patient experience.
